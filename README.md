# Deephaven Doom

Based on the Vite TypeScript template, and then inspired by [this blog post](https://healeycodes.com/doom-rendered-via-checkboxes) about rendering Doom with checkboxes. Renders Doom in the @deephaven/grid component. Click into the Grid and then play doom!

Run `npm run dev` to run this.
